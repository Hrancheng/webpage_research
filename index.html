            <p>Language use in human communication is shaped by our goals, our shared experiences, and our understanding of each other's abilities, knowledge, and beliefs. Led by <a href="#">Prof. Joyce Chai</a>, the Situated Language and Embodied Dialogue (SLED) lab (formerly, the LAIR group) develops computational models for natural language processing that take into account rich physical, situational, and communicative context and build embodied AI agents that strive to collaborate with humans through language communication.</p>
